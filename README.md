Welcome to _Dimecoin Wallet_, a standalone Dimecoin payment app for your Android device!

This project contains several sub-projects:

 * __wallet__:
     The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for.
 * __integration-android__:
     A tiny library for integrating Dimecoin payments into your own Android app
     (e.g. donations, in-app purchases).
 * __sample-integration-android__:
     A minimal example app to demonstrate integration of Dimecoin payments into
     your Android app.

You can build all sub-projects at once using Gradle:

`gradle clean build`
